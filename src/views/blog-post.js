             This project is created as a requirement for the completion in one of the Major Subject (Human Computer Interaction) of the Developers and as 
             a fan of the Boyband SB19, we decided to create a website that will help the fans to know more about the members of the group. The group inspired
             us through their music and experience in life which make us want to know more about them. We hope that this website will help the fans to know more about them.

           And as of now, we are still working on the project to make it more interactive and user friendly. We hope that you will support us in this project. This project is not developed
           for commercial use and is only for educational purposes.

          Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
          - 2 Corinthians 4:16-18
